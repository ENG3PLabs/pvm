# PVM for Windows

Removing the hassle of changing PHP versions in the CLI on Windows.

This package has a much more niche use case than nvm does. When developing on Windows and using the integrated terminal, it's quite difficult to get those terminals to _actually_ listen to PATH changes.

This utility changes that.

## Installation

The installation process is a little convoluted. You need PHP already installed for it to work, which I admit isn't ideal.
